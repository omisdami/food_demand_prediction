# Inventory Forecasting Model Performance Improvement Journey

## Executive Summary

This document chronicles the comprehensive development and comparison of inventory forecasting models, showcasing how systematic improvements transformed failing regression models (R² = -0.189) into highly accurate predictors (R² = 0.871), while also demonstrating why ARIMA time series models failed for this particular dataset. The journey includes regression model optimization, ARIMA implementation, model comparison, and the development of a production-ready forecasting tool.

## Initial State: Poor Performance

### Original Results
- **R² Score**: -0.189 (worse than predicting the mean)
- **MAE**: ~197 units
- **RMSE**: ~538 units
- **Models**: Basic Linear Regression and Ridge Regression
- **Status**: Complete failure - models were not learning meaningful patterns

### Key Problems Identified
1. **Negative R² scores**: Models performing worse than baseline
2. **High error rates**: Predictions far from actual values
3. **Small dataset**: Only 106 rows with 104 usable after feature engineering
4. **Poor feature engineering**: Simple lag features and rolling averages
5. **No feature selection**: Using all 26+ features leading to overfitting
6. **No preprocessing**: Raw features without scaling
7. **Suboptimal train/test split**: 80/20 split not ideal for time series

## Iteration Process: Systematic Improvements

### Phase 1: Enhanced Feature Engineering

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced 2-lag features with single lag to reduce noise
- Added 3-day and 7-day rolling averages instead of just 2-day
- Introduced calendar features: `day_of_month`, `is_weekend`
- Added trend feature: `days_since_start`
- Created cross-product features:
  - `wings_tenders_ratio`: Relationship between main items
  - `fries_total`: Combined fries quantities
  - `total_food`: Overall food demand indicator

**Rationale:**
- Longer rolling windows capture better trends
- Cross-product features reveal item relationships
- Calendar features capture seasonal patterns
- Trend features help with long-term patterns

### Phase 2: Data Preprocessing

**Changes Made:**
- **Feature Scaling**: Added `StandardScaler` to normalize all features
- **Feature Selection**: Implemented correlation-based selection to choose top 15 features
- **Better Train/Test Split**: Changed from 80/20 to 75/25 for better time series validation

**Rationale:**
- Scaling ensures all features contribute equally
- Feature selection reduces overfitting with small datasets
- 75/25 split provides more test data for reliable evaluation

### Phase 3: Model Diversification

**Changes Made:**
- Added **Lasso Regression**: L1 regularization for automatic feature selection
- Added **ElasticNet**: Combined L1 and L2 regularization
- Added **Random Forest**: Non-linear model for comparison
- Increased Ridge alpha from 1.0 to 10.0 for stronger regularization

**Rationale:**
- Different algorithms capture different patterns
- Regularization prevents overfitting
- Ensemble methods can handle non-linear relationships

### Phase 4: Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning

**Changes Made:**
- **Time Series Cross-Validation**: Implemented `TimeSeriesSplit` with 3 folds for proper temporal validation
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Added `GridSearchCV` for all models with optimized parameter grids
- **Model Expansion**: Added Lasso and ElasticNet regression models
- **Comprehensive Parameter Search**:
  - Ridge: alpha values [0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 50.0, 100.0]
  - Lasso: alpha values [0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 50.0]
  - ElasticNet: alpha [0.1, 1.0, 10.0] × l1_ratio [0.1, 0.5, 0.7, 0.9]
  - Random Forest: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split combinations

**Rationale:**
- Time series CV prevents data leakage and provides realistic performance estimates
- Automated hyperparameter tuning finds optimal model configurations
- Cross-validation scores help detect overfitting vs underfitting

### Phase 5: Enhanced Evaluation and Visualization

**Changes Made:**
- **Advanced Visualizations**: 4 comprehensive plot types covering all aspects
- **Overfitting Detection**: CV vs Test performance comparison
- **Per-Target Analysis**: Individual performance metrics for each inventory item
- **Residual Analysis**: Model assumption validation through residual plots
- **Error Distribution**: Box plots showing error patterns across models

## Final Results: Dramatic Improvement

## Key Learnings

### What Worked
1. **Feature Selection**: Reducing from 26+ to 15 features eliminated noise
2. **Proper Scaling**: StandardScaler was crucial for model performance
3. **Regularization**: Lasso's L1 penalty automatically selected important features
4. **Better Features**: Rolling averages and ratios captured business relationships
5. **Linear Models**: Simple linear relationships dominated the data patterns
6. **Time Series CV**: Proper validation prevented overfitting and gave realistic estimates
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV found optimal parameters automatically
8. **Cross-Validation Consistency**: Lasso showed excellent generalization (CV: 23.09 vs Test: 23.36)

### What Didn't Work
1. **Random Forest**: Severe overfitting (CV: 48.72 vs Test: 74.88 MAE)
2. **Linear Regression Instability**: High CV variance (±29.98) indicating inconsistent performance
3. **Complex Features**: Over-engineering features initially hurt performance

### Overfitting Analysis
- **Lasso**: Excellent generalization (difference: +0.27)
- **Ridge**: Good generalization (difference: -5.36)
- **ElasticNet**: Good generalization (difference: -4.16)
- **Linear Regression**: Potential underfitting (difference: -16.95)
- **Random Forest**: Clear overfitting (difference: +26.16)

### Business Insights
- **Seasonality Matters**: Calendar features (weekend, month) are important predictors
- **Item Relationships**: Ratios between items (wings/tenders) reveal demand patterns
- **Trend Component**: Long-term trends (`days_since_start`) improve accuracy
- **Rolling Averages**: 7-day windows better than shorter periods for trend capture


## Recommendations for Future Improvements

### ARIMA Results: Comprehensive Failure

**Overall Performance:**
- **Average MAE: 155.32** (6.6x worse than Lasso regression)
- **Average R²: -0.043** (negative = worse than predicting the mean)
- **Status: Complete failure for this dataset**

**Individual ARIMA Model Performance:**
| Item | Model Type | Parameters | MAE | R² | Status |
|------|------------|------------|-----|----|---------| 
| Wings | ARIMA | (0,1,0) | 774.14 | -0.011 | Failed |
| Tenders | ARIMA | (3,1,2) | 138.96 | -0.041 | Failed |
| Fries_reg | ARIMA | (0,1,3) | 22.56 | 0.050 | Acceptable |
| Fries_large | ARIMA | (4,2,3) | 36.97 | -0.097 | Failed |
| Veggies | ARIMA | (1,2,3) | 34.88 | -0.065 | Failed |
| Dips | ARIMA | (0,1,4) | 88.31 | -0.013 | Failed |
| Drinks | ARIMA | (0,2,1) | 32.41 | 0.054 | Acceptable |
| Flavours | ARIMA | (3,2,0) | 114.30 | -0.223 | Failed |

### Why ARIMA Failed

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. **Insufficient Temporal Patterns**: The inventory data is more driven by external factors (calendar, ratios) than pure time series patterns
2. **Small Dataset**: 106 records insufficient for complex ARIMA parameter estimation
3. **Linear Relationships Dominate**: The underlying patterns are primarily linear, not autoregressive
4. **Weak Seasonality**: Daily inventory doesn't show strong seasonal patterns that ARIMA can exploit
5. **External Factor Dependency**: Demand driven by business logic (ratios, totals) rather than historical values

**Technical Issues:**
- **Overfitting**: Complex ARIMA models (4,2,3) overfitted to noise
- **Parameter Instability**: High-order models produced unstable forecasts
- **Negative R² Scores**: Models consistently worse than naive mean prediction

## Phase 7: Production Tool Development

### Restaurant Forecast Tool

**Features Implemented:**
- **Multi-Model Support**: Both regression and ARIMA models with automatic comparison
- **Flexible Dataset Input**: Command-line dataset specification
- **Training vs Prediction Modes**: `--predict` flag for using pre-trained models
- **Model Selection**: Choose regression, ARIMA, or both models
